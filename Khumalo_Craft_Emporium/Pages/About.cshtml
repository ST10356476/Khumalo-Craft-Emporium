        <p class="about-paragraph">At Khumalo Crafts, our story is as vibrant and intricate as the crafts we create. It all began with a dream – a dream to celebrate African artistry, culture, and tradition through exquisite handmade crafts.</p>

        <p class="about-paragraph">Founded in the heart of Pretoria in 2024 by Sam Khumalo, Khumalo Crafts started as a small artisan workshop in their backyard. Fuelled by their passion for craftsmanship and a desire to preserve and promote African heritage, the Khumalo siblings embarked on a journey to turn their vision into reality.</p>

Every piece in our collection is lovingly handmade by skilled artisans using traditional techniques passed down through generations. From intricately woven baskets to beautifully carved wooden sculptures, each creation tells a unique story and reflects the rich tapestry of African heritage.</p>
